    <h2>KRUSHING BLOWS:</h2>
    <p>Black Dragon Bash(D2):Triggers if this attack <b> KOUNTERS </b> or <b> PUNISHES </b> a <b> HIGH ATTACK</b></p>
    <p>Forward and Back Throw(1+3):Triggers if opponent failed <b> THROW ESCAPE </b>during previous <b>THROW.</b></p>
    <p>Enzuigiri(B3):Triggers if this <b>MID</b>is a <b>KOUNTER</b>or<b>PUNISH</b>.</p>
    <p>Penal Colony(F43): Triggers if opponent blocks late(during or after) <b> ACTIVE FRAMES</b> </p>
    <p>Lumbar Check Amplified(DBF3AMP): Triggers if opponent is hit during a <b> GETUP ROLL</b></p>
    <p>In the Ripper variation, Kano gains access to new strings, a parry, and a command grab. His new strings
        include a launcher in his 241+3 string that will be your go to punish in this variation, the F43 to get extra damage when F4 hits
        and 221+3 where Kano can amplify the end of the string for increased damage. The parry(Rack Off) is especially helpful, and it can stop opponents who
        are playing offensively in their tracks. To be able to play this variation efficently, you need the use Kano's command grab
        (Lumbar Check) to its full ability. This command range has a bigger throw range than Kano's toward and back throws, and can be special canceled
        from his 11 and 24 string, and from D1, D3, or D4. All of these moves combined can make Kano a hassle to deal with.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <p>Rack Off(Parry) has a lot of active frames, this can frustrate your opponent, and make them second guess themselves about attacking you. Use 
        this to your advanatge to pressure them.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Play:</h2>
    <ul>
        
    <p><li>Kano gains a mixup with his 11, 24 strings where you can special cancel into the command grab, or fully commit to the rest of the string (112, 241+3).
        Your opponent will have to guess if you are going for the command grab, or fully commiting to the rest of the string. Both the strings and command grab
        are punishable, so keep your opponent guessing by mixing up the command grab with the full strings.</p></li>
    <p><li>Kano also gains a mixup with his D1,D3,and D4 buttons. You can either special cancel these buttons into the command grab(Lumbar Check), or the Kano Ball(BF3)
        Both of these mixups are very unsafe, so use these mixups carefully.</li>
