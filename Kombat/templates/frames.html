<h1>What are frames?</h1>

<p> Frames are absolutley esstential when it comes to fighting games, Pros use this data to learn how to counter their opponents every move, and optimize their
    play to the fullest
</p>

<h2> Types of Frames:</h2>

<p><b>Startup</b>: the number of frames it takes for the move to hit an opponent. Startup Frames are the type of frames that begin a move animation</p>
<b><p>Example: </b>You decide to input a button that starts up in 9 frames. Your opponent inputs a button that starts up at 11 frames, 
if you and your opponent press these buttons on the exact same frame, you would hit your opponent rather than the opposite due to the fact
that your 9 frame move started up faster than their 11 frame start up frame move </p>
<p><b>Active</b>: the number of frames the move can hit an oppponent. The frames that occur when startup frames finish </p>
<p><b>Example: </b>Kano's F4(Wheel Kick) has 4 active frames, once the move starts up in 25 frames, the move will be able to hit the opponent
for 4 frames,depending on this move hits an opponent, is blocked, or whiffs will determine what kind of frames will begin once the active frames are done.</p>
<p><b>Recovery</b>: the number of frames the move takes to recover </p>
<p><b>Hit Advantage</b>: the number of frames that the player can input a button press before an opponent</p>
<p><b>Block Advantage</b>: the number of frames that the player can input a button before or after an opponent depending on if the move is plus or minus frames</p>
<p><b>Flawless Block Advantage</b>: the number of frames that the player can input a button before or after a FLAWLESS BLOCK</p>
